CitySDK Linked Data API
=======================

The CitySDK Linked Data API, developed by [Waag Society](http://waag.org/) is a
layer-based data distribution and service kit. Part of
[CitySDK](http://citysdk.eu), a European project in which eight cities
(Manchester, Rome, Lamia, Amsterdam, Helsinki, Barcelona, Lisbon and Istanbul)
and more than 20 organisations collaborate, the CitySDK Mobility API enables
easy development and distribution of digital services across different cities.

Although the initial focus in developing this part of the API was on mobility,
the approach chosen allows any (open) data to be made available in a uniform
and flexible manner.

A running implementation of the api can be found at
[http://dev.citysdk.waag.org](http://dev.citysdk.waag.org); this is also where
you'll find additional documentation.
